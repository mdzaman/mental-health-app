I'll help create a comprehensive technical requirements document based on the mental health application specifications. Let me break this down into a detailed technical architecture.



I've created a comprehensive technical requirements document that outlines the architecture and implementation details for the mental health application. The document covers all major aspects including:

1. System Architecture with detailed microservices breakdown
2. Data flow patterns for real-time and analytics
3. Security and compliance requirements
4. Deployment strategy
5. Development requirements
6. Infrastructure specifications
7. Mobile application requirements
8. Performance metrics
9. Scalability considerations

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular section or discuss specific implementation details for any of the microservices? I can also create more detailed diagrams for specific components or data flows if needed.

The architecture is designed to be cloud-native and serverless-first, with AWS Lambda handling most of the computational workload. This approach ensures maximum scalability and cost-effectiveness while maintaining high performance. Each microservice is independently deployable and scalable, following domain-driven design principles.

Would you like me to focus on any specific aspect of the technical requirements?
